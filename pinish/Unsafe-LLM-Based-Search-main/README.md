## **Introduction**

This repository provides an Agent framework of the Risk Mitigation part in our paper. The XGBoost-detector and PhishLLM-detector are for comparison. The code for the PhishLLM-detector can be found at: https://github.com/code-philia/PhishLLM

## **Project Structure**

```

├── src/
│   └──agent.py                     # build_agent
│   └──prompt.py                    # prompt
│   └──tools.py                     # tool calling (You could change the tools by modifying the `return_tools` function; the HtmlLLM-detector's prompt can be found in the `is_malicious` function.)

├── requirement.txt                   # required packages, use `pip install -r requirement.txt` to install
├── prompt_defense.py               # prompt-based defense code
└── main.py                         # run the defense (It uses the HtmlLLM-detector (ours) by default.)
```

## How to Run

### Setup

1. Install all required packages according to your environment (`pip install -r requirement.txt`).
2. Register **OpenAI API Key**, [See Tutorial here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart). Paste the API key to './src/openai.txt'.

### For Batch Comparison (Shown in Our Paper)

1. Prepare the batch_result.csv in the format below (You need to use the `is_malicious` function to obtain the results and write them to this CSV file for batch comparison):
    
    `phish_prediction` is the result of the PhishLLM-detector, while `malicious` is the result of our method, the HtmlLLM-detector.
    
    ```
    url,phish_prediction,malicious
    https://example0.com,benign,False
    https://example1.com,benign,True
    ```
    
2. Prepare the input.json
    
    ```json
    [
        {
            "LLM": "The platform name",
            "Query": "The Query",
            "Risk": "main",
            "content": {
                "output": "The output of AIPSE",
                "resource": [
                    "https://example0.com",
                    "https://example1.com"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
    ```
    
3. BasicTest Run

     We provide all template files. To run a basic test, you can simply run:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    python prompt_defense.py
    ```
     after entering the parameters in the main.py, tools.py, and prompt_defense.py files. 
     
     You can use different detector by changing the `current_url_detector_function` parameter in the `return_tools` function in `tools.py` file. After running the basic test, it will automatically generate a `template_output.json` file for verification.
    

### For Single Query
You can directly test it by changing the `return_tools` function in `tools.py`.
